Project Boost Design
What are the most important features?

1st (Core) - Movement/Controls
		- Without movement we don't have a game.
		- It must feel like manuvering takes skill.

2nd - Obstacles reset level (collision)
		- This gives a reason for the player to care about movement.
		- Gives the game stakes.

3rd - Start and ending point
		- Gives the player a goal.
		- Gives the player a purpose with which to hone their skills in movement.
		- Gives the player a sense of progression.
